> The project showcases three console programmes which utilise arrays to solve problems: 
<hr>

## Bubble sort: 
A bubble sort of array items in both ascending and descending order. 


## Dimensional array sort:
A sorting of a _"two-dimensional"_ array and then pushing its row elements to cycle from left to right, and then from right to left, a little bit more each time it goes down a row. 

## Game of entropy: 
A program that creates _"cells"_, represented as the char 'x' and has them either multiply or die each cycle, based on the rules of John Horton Conway's ["Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules "Link to the rules on Wikipedia"). It is set up to run for 50 cycles, unless it runs into a loop where the cells start repeating the same behaviour.
