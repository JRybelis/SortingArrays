# Java arrays practice

> The project showcases three console programmes which utilise arrays to solve problems: 
<hr>
1. A bubble sort of the array items in both ascending and descending order. 
2. A sorting of a "two-dimensional" array and then pushing its row elements to cycle from left to right, and then from right to left, a little bit more each time it goes down a row. 
3. A program that creates "cells", represented as the char 'x' and has them either multiply or die each cycle, based on the rules of John Horton Conway's "Life". It is set up to run for 50 cycles, unless it runs into a loop where the cells start repeating the same behaviour.
